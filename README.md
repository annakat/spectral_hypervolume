# Spectral hypervolumes
Data and R code and data calculating the spectral space (hypervolume) occupied by individual trees in the Forest and Biodiversity I (FAB) and Biodiversity II (BioDIV) experiments at the Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve (East Bethel, MN). Hypervolume calculations are based on the R package hypervolume, version 2.0.12, by Benjamin Blonder and with contributions from David J. Harris (2019).

## Content
1) FAB_ind_spec.csv: Leaf-level spectra from FAB

2) FAB_ind_growth.csv: Tree height and diameter for trees in FAB

3) FAB_comm_productivity.csv: Net biodiversity (NBE), complementarity (CE) and selection effects (SE) per community in FAB, see Grossmann et al. 2017

4) BB_ind_spec.csv: Leaf-level spectra from BioDIV

5) BB_comm_productivity: Total aboveground biomass per community in BioDIV

6) FAB_hypervol_indiv.R: Code for calculating the spectral space occupied by individuals trees in FAB and their correlation with tree growth

7) FAB_hypervol_comm.R: Code for calculating the spectral space occupied by communities in FAB and their correlation with community productivity (NBE, CE, SE) and species richness

8) BB_hypervol_comm.R: Code for calculating the spectral space occupied by communities in BioDIV and their correlation with community productivity and species richness
